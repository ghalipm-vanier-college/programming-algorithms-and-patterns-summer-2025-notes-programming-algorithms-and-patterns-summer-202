# Lab 1: Mastering Arrays
________________________________________
## Objective: To reinforce understanding of fixed-size data structures and basic array operations, including specific analytical tasks.
### Instructions:

### 1.	Array Declaration and Initialization:
*	Declare an integer array named scores of size 5 and initialize it with any five integer values between 0 and 100.
*	Declare a String array named daysOfWeek and initialize it directly with the names of the seven days of the week.

### 2.	Accessing and Modifying Elements:
*	Print the third element of the scores array.
*	Change the value of the first element in the scores array to 100 and print it.
*	Print the last element of the daysOfWeek array.

### 3.	Iterating Through Arrays:
*	Use a for loop to print all elements of the scores array.
*	Use an enhanced for loop (for-each loop) to print all elements of the daysOfWeek array.

### 4.	Array Length:
*	Print the length of both the scores array and the daysOfWeek array.

### 5.	New Tasks with nums Array:
*	Given an array of integer numbers: int[] nums = {5, 7, 8, 10, 17, 24, 31, 36};
*	Task 1: Find the maximum value. Write code to find and print the maximum value in the nums array.
*	Task 2: Find the sum. Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the nums array.
*	Task 3: Assign even numbers to a new array. Create a new integer array called evens. Iterate through nums and assign all even numbers into the evens array. Print the evens array.

### 6.	Conceptual Questions on Arrays:
*	Question 1: Can you add or delete an integer to or from the nums array (the one defined in Task 5) after it has been created? Explain why or why not.
*	Question 2: Can you create an array in Java like [1, 0, true, false]? Explain why or why not.

### 7.	Task 4: Student Data and Average Grade:
*	Make an array to store data for 5 students. Each student should have a first name (String) and a grade (double).
*	Calculate their average grade and print it. (Hint: You might need to consider how to store mixed data types in an array or if you need separate arrays for names and grades).

### 8.	Optional Challenge: Searching in an Array:
*	Write a simple linear search algorithm to find if the number 50 exists in the scores array. Print a message indicating whether it was found or not.
