# Programming Algorithms and Patterns Summer 2025
This course explores the organization, manipulation, and 
algorithmic implementation of data structures such as 
`arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees`, 
using Java. It aims to enhance `OOP` 
skills through designing and implementing standalone applications, 
and may cover `design patterns, lambda expressions, recursion, 
and multi-threading` if time allows.
